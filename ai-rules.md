# AI Integration Guidelines

## AI Behavior Rules

1. **Privacy First**
   - AI components must not store or transmit user data outside the application without explicit consent
   - All data processing should be transparent to the user
   - Implement data minimization principles

2. **User Control**
   - Users must always have the option to opt out of AI features
   - Provide clear settings to customize AI behavior
   - Allow users to delete their data and conversation history

3. **Transparency**
   - Clearly indicate when content is AI-generated
   - Provide confidence levels for AI-generated responses when appropriate
   - Explain how user inputs are being processed

4. **Ethical Boundaries**
   - AI must not generate harmful, illegal, or discriminatory content
   - Implement content filtering for both inputs and outputs
   - Have fallback responses for inappropriate requests

5. **Accuracy**
   - AI should acknowledge uncertainty rather than provide incorrect information
   - Include citations or sources when providing factual information
   - Implement feedback mechanisms to improve accuracy over time

## Implementation Guidelines

### Frontend AI Integration

1. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear loading indicators during AI processing
   - Implement graceful fallbacks for AI failures
   - Design intuitive interfaces for AI interaction

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handle AI service unavailability gracefully
   - Provide helpful error messages
   - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize AI requests to minimize latency
   - Consider implementing client-side caching for common requests
   - Use streaming responses for long-form AI content

### Backend AI Processing

1. **Model Selection**
   - Choose appropriate models based on the specific task requirements
   - Consider the tradeoff between model size and performance
   - Document model versions and capabilities

2. **Input Validation**
   - Sanitize all user inputs before processing
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Filter out harmful or inappropriate content

3. **Output Processing**
   - Validate AI outputs before returning to the frontend
   - Format responses consistently
   - Add metadata about the processing (model used, confidence, etc.)

## Testing Requirements

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test AI components with a variety of inputs
   - Verify correct handling of edge cases
   - Ensure appropriate responses to inappropriate requests

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure and optimize response times
   - Test under various load conditions
   - Verify graceful degradation under stress

3. **Bias and Fairness Testing**
   - Evaluate responses across different demographic groups
   - Test for and mitigate potential biases
   - Ensure inclusive and respectful language

## Monitoring and Improvement

1. **Usage Analytics**
   - Track AI feature usage and performance
   - Identify common failure patterns
   - Monitor for unexpected behavior

2. **Feedback Collection**
   - Implement user feedback mechanisms
   - Regularly review and categorize feedback
   - Use feedback to improve AI responses

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regularly update AI models and processing logic
   - A/B test new approaches
   - Document improvements and changes

## Compliance Considerations

1. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Ensure compliance with relevant AI regulations
   - Implement appropriate data protection measures
   - Maintain records of processing activities

2. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure AI features are accessible to users with disabilities
   - Provide alternative interaction methods when appropriate
   - Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain clear documentation of AI capabilities and limitations
   - Document data processing workflows
   - Keep records of model training and evaluation
