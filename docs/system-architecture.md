# System Architecture Overview

## 1. Overall System Architecture

### Frontend (User Interface)
- Built with Next.js and Vercel AI SDK
- Serves as the direct interface for user interaction
- Handles dynamic content rendering and AI-powered features
- Responsible for visual presentation and user experience

### Backend (Business Logic & Data Processing)
- Python-based backend (FastAPI)
- Processes data and applies business/AI logic
- Performs complex calculations and operations
- Acts as the "brain" of the system

### Communication Between Layers
- RESTful API endpoints connect frontend and backend
- Frontend makes API calls to request data or processing
- Backend processes requests and returns structured responses
- Clear separation allows independent scaling and maintenance

## 2. Component Breakdown

### Frontend Components
- **UI Components**: Interactive elements (buttons, forms, input fields)
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK components for AI model interaction
- **Edge Functions**: Optimized code running closer to users for improved performance
- **State Management**: Handling application state and user session data

### Backend Components
- **API Endpoints**: Defined routes that handle specific frontend requests
- **Business Logic**: Core algorithms and processing pipelines
- **AI Processing**: Machine learning models and inference logic
- **Data Management**: Database interactions and external service integration

## 3. Data Flow

1. **User Action**
   - User interacts with the frontend interface
   - Input is captured through UI components

2. **Frontend Processing**
   - Input validation and initial processing
   - API request preparation using Vercel AI SDK

3. **Backend Processing**
   - Request reception and validation
   - Application of business logic and AI algorithms
   - Data processing and result generation

4. **Response Display**
   - Backend sends processed data to frontend
   - Frontend renders the response for the user
   - UI updates to reflect new information

## 4. Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- Frontend focuses on user experience and presentation
- Backend specializes in processing and data operations
- Each layer can be developed and optimized independently

### Flexibility
- Easy integration of new AI features through the SDK
- Backend can be scaled based on processing demands
- Components can be updated or replaced individually

### Maintainability
- Clear boundaries between system components
- Isolated testing and debugging capabilities
- Simplified deployment and version management
